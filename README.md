# Colosseum

The colosseum project is a place where I try to automate my research code base and create a plugin based ecosystem to run research pipelines.

The code has been designed to integrate with other research 0projects provided they follow a basic naming convention.

The architecture is simple with the following folder.

1. modules
2. views
3. inputs
4. outputs: When in offline mode all the 
5. server: Once a module is ready to be published you can quickly create a fastapi based server to serve your modules.

## Current Initiatives

Currently I am working on two research problems.

1. Prisoners Dilemma Based Game Theory research.
2. Sokoban solver.

### Prisoners Dilemma

This is a simulator + analyser for the classic game of prisoners dilemma in game theory.

#### Setup
To start playing the game you must perform the following steps.

```
sudo apt install ffmpeg virtualenv
virtualenv isolation
source isolation/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Registered Players
1. Jesus: A player who never retaliates
2. Judas: An envious player who only cooperates while it is winning. Otherwise it defects.
3. Tit for Tat: A player who starts out by cooperating but retaliates immediately when deceived.
4. Joker: A random player who believes in anarchy and plays with a random strategy. Because Chaos is Fair...
5. Lucifer: A player who always defects.
6. Worse and Worse: A player who defects more as the game proceeds. Essentially drawing out the worst in its opponents as the game proceeds.
7. Better and Better: A player who cooperates mre as the game goes on. Essentially bringing out the bestv in their opponents as the game proceeds.
8. Grudger: A player who holds grudges and stops cooperating once an opponent defects.

### Sokoban Solver

This is a solevr for sokoban puzzles.
It is an initiative to further the research in artificial intelligence to plan future moves with heuristics without bruteforcing.
